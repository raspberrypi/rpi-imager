NAME
     archive_write_get_bytes_per_block, archive_write_set_bytes_per_block,
     archive_write_get_bytes_in_last_block,
     archive_write_set_bytes_in_last_block — functions for creating archives

LIBRARY
     Streaming Archive Library (libarchive, -larchive)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <archive.h>

     int
     archive_write_get_bytes_per_block(struct archive *);

     int
     archive_write_set_bytes_per_block(struct archive *, int bytes_per_block);

     int
     archive_write_get_bytes_in_last_block(struct archive *);

     int
     archive_write_set_bytes_in_last_block(struct archive *, int);

DESCRIPTION
     archive_write_set_bytes_per_block()
	     Sets the block size used for writing the archive data.  Every
	     call to the write callback function, except possibly the last
	     one, will use this value for the length.  The default is to use a
	     block size of 10240 bytes.  Note that a block size of zero will
	     suppress internal blocking and cause writes to be sent directly
	     to the write callback as they occur.

     archive_write_get_bytes_per_block()
	     Retrieve the block size to be used for writing.  A value of -1
	     here indicates that the library should use default values.  A
	     value of zero indicates that internal blocking is suppressed.

     archive_write_set_bytes_in_last_block()
	     Sets the block size used for writing the last block.  If this
	     value is zero, the last block will be padded to the same size as
	     the other blocks.	Otherwise, the final block will be padded to a
	     multiple of this size.  In particular, setting it to 1 will cause
	     the final block to not be padded.	For compressed output, any
	     padding generated by this option is applied only after the com‐
	     pression.	The uncompressed data is always unpadded.  The default
	     is to pad the last block to the full block size (note that
	     archive_write_open_filename() will set this based on the file
	     type).  Unlike the other “set” functions, this function can be
	     called after the archive is opened.

     archive_write_get_bytes_in_last_block()
	     Retrieve the currently-set value for last block size.  A value of
	     -1 here indicates that the library should use default values.

RETURN VALUES
     archive_write_set_bytes_per_block() and
     archive_write_set_bytes_in_last_block() return ARCHIVE_OK on success, or
     ARCHIVE_FATAL.

     archive_write_get_bytes_per_block() and
     archive_write_get_bytes_in_last_block() return currently configured block
     size (-1 indicates the default block size), or ARCHIVE_FATAL.

ERRORS
     Detailed error codes and textual descriptions are available from the
     archive_errno() and archive_error_string() functions.
