ARCHIVE_ENTRY(3)	 BSD Library Functions Manual	      ARCHIVE_ENTRY(3)

NAME
     archive_entry_clear, archive_entry_clone, archive_entry_free,
     archive_entry_new — functions for managing archive entry descriptions

LIBRARY
     Streaming Archive Library (libarchive, -larchive)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <archive_entry.h>

     struct archive_entry *
     archive_entry_clear(struct archive_entry *);

     struct archive_entry *
     archive_entry_clone(struct archive_entry *);

     void
     archive_entry_free(struct archive_entry *);

     struct archive_entry *
     archive_entry_new(void);

DESCRIPTION
     These functions create and manipulate data objects that represent entries
     within an archive.  You can think of a struct archive_entry as a heavy-
     duty version of struct stat: it includes everything from struct stat plus
     associated pathname, textual group and user names, etc.  These objects
     are used by libarchive(3) to represent the metadata associated with a
     particular entry in an archive.

   Create and Destroy
     There are functions to allocate, destroy, clear, and copy archive_entry
     objects:
     archive_entry_clear()
	     Erases the object, resetting all internal fields to the same
	     state as a newly-created object.  This is provided to allow you
	     to quickly recycle objects without thrashing the heap.
     archive_entry_clone()
	     A deep copy operation; all text fields are duplicated.
     archive_entry_free()
	     Releases the struct archive_entry object.
     archive_entry_new()
	     Allocate and return a blank struct archive_entry object.

   Function groups
     Due to high number of functions, the accessor functions can be found in
     man pages grouped by the purpose.

     archive_entry_acl(3)    Access Control List manipulation

     archive_entry_paths(3)  Path name manipulation

     archive_entry_perms(3)  User, group and mode manipulation

     archive_entry_stat(3)   Functions not in the other groups and copying
			     to/from struct stat.

     archive_entry_time(3)   Time field manipulation

     Most of the functions set or read entries in an object.  Such functions
     have one of the following forms:
     archive_entry_set_XXXX()
	     Stores the provided data in the object.  In particular, for
	     strings, the pointer is stored, not the referenced string.
     archive_entry_copy_XXXX()
	     As above, except that the referenced data is copied into the ob‐
	     ject.
     archive_entry_XXXX()
	     Returns the specified data.  In the case of strings, a const-
	     qualified pointer to the string is returned.
     String data can be set or accessed as wide character strings or normal
     char strings.  The functions that use wide character strings are suffixed
     with _w.  Note that these are different representations of the same data:
     For example, if you store a narrow string and read the corresponding wide
     string, the object will transparently convert formats using the current
     locale.  Similarly, if you store a wide string and then store a narrow
     string for the same data, the previously-set wide string will be dis‐
     carded in favor of the new data.
