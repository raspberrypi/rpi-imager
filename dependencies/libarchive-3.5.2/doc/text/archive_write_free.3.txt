ARCHIVE_WRITE_FREE(3)	 BSD Library Functions Manual	 ARCHIVE_WRITE_FREE(3)

NAME
     archive_write_fail, archive_write_close, archive_write_finish,
     archive_write_free — functions for creating archives

LIBRARY
     Streaming Archive Library (libarchive, -larchive)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <archive.h>

     int
     archive_write_fail(struct archive *);

     int
     archive_write_close(struct archive *);

     int
     archive_write_finish(struct archive *);

     int
     archive_write_free(struct archive *);

DESCRIPTION
     archive_write_fail()
	     Always returns ARCHIVE_FATAL.  This marks the archive object as
	     being unusable; after calling this function, the only call that
	     can succeed is archive_write_free() to release the resources.
	     This can be used to speed recovery when the archive creation must
	     be aborted.  Note that the created archive is likely to be mal‐
	     formed in this case;

     archive_write_close()
	     Complete the archive and invoke the close callback.

     archive_write_finish()
	     This is a deprecated synonym for archive_write_free().

     archive_write_free()
	     Invokes archive_write_close() if necessary, then releases all re‐
	     sources.  If you need detailed information about
	     archive_write_close() failures, you should be careful to call it
	     separately, as you cannot obtain error information after
	     archive_write_free() returns.

RETURN VALUES
     These functions return ARCHIVE_OK on success, or ARCHIVE_FATAL.

ERRORS
     Detailed error codes and textual descriptions are available from the
     archive_errno() and archive_error_string() functions.
