      # Disable Wayland back-end until the dependency problem gets resolved.
      # Essentially, importing libqwayland-generic causes the AppImage dependency walker
      # to find libwayland-client from the build OS, and include that in the AppImage.
      # This is deleterious - because the the runtime OS graphics stack also depends on that
      # library to create native window types. With no strong ABI versioning on that library,
      # you wind up with exotic symbol resolution failures at runtime.
