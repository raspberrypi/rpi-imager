The settings used when compressing a file determine the memory requirements of the decompressor.  Typically the decompressor needs 5\\ % to 20\\ % of the amount of memory that the compressor needed when creating the file.  For example, decompressing a file created with B<xz -9> currently requires 65\\ MiB of memory.  Still, it is possible to have B<.xz> files that require several gigabytes of memory to decompress."

To prevent uncomfortable surprises, B<xz> has a built-in memory usage limiter, which is disabled by default.  While some operating systems provide ways to limit the memory usage of processes, relying on it wasn't deemed to be flexible enough (for example, using B<ulimit>(1)  to limit virtual memory tends to cripple B<mmap>(2))."

Often it is more convenient to enable the limiter by default by setting the environment variable B<XZ_DEFAULTS>, for example, B<XZ_DEFAULTS=--memlimit=150MiB>.  It is possible to set the limits separately for compression and decompression by using B<--memlimit-compress=>I<limit> and B<--memlimit-decompress=>I<limit>.  Using these two options outside B<XZ_DEFAULTS> is rarely useful because a single run of B<xz> cannot do both compression and decompression and B<--memlimit=>I<limit> (or B<-M> I<limit>)  is shorter to type on the command line."

If the limit is exceeded when compressing, B<xz> will try to scale the settings down so that the limit is no longer exceeded (except when using B<--format=raw> or B<--no-adjust>).  This way the operation won't fail unless the limit is very small.  The scaling of the settings is done in steps that don't match the compression level presets, for example, if the limit is only slightly less than the amount required for B<xz -9>, the settings will be scaled down only a little, not all the way down to B<xz -8>."
