Version 8.8.0 (22 May 2024)

Daniel Stenberg (22 May 2024)

- RELEASE-NOTES: synced

- THANKS: add contributors from 8.8.0

- url: remove duplicate call to Curl_conncache_remove_conn when pruning

  - remove unnecessary prunedead struct from prune_dead_connections
  - rename extract_if_dead to prune_if_dead for clarity

  Closes #13710

- curl_setup.h: add support for IAR compiler

  Closes #13728

Stephen Farrell (21 May 2024)

- docs/ECH: typo/clarification

  Closes #13727

- hash: delete unused debug function

  It had no use in the curl codebase and was also protected by the macro
  `AGGRESSIVE_TEST` (renamed in 2020), also with no local reference.

  Added in ca6e77083768858aa34207f8c5dce38b3c05336d (2002-11-11)

  Closes #13729

Stefan Eissing (21 May 2024)

- content_encoding: reject transfer-encoding after chunked

  reject a response that applies a transfer-encoding after a 'chunked'
  encoding. RFC 9112 ch. 6.1 required chunked to be the final encoding.

  Closes #13733

- http: HEAD response body tolerance

  - as reported in #13725, some servers wrongly send body bytes in
    responses to a HEAD request. This used to be tolerated in curl
    8.4 and before and leads to failed transfers in newer versions.
  - restore previous behaviour for HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2:
    * 1.1: do not add 'Transfer-Encoding' writers from HEAD
      responses. RFC 9112 says they do not apply.
    * 2: when the transfer expects 'no_body', to not report stream
      resets as error when all response headers have been received.

- tests: fix TFTP test 2305 on Windows

  Ref: #13692
  Closes #13724

Jay Satiro (20 May 2024)

- openssl: revert keylog_callback support for LibreSSL

  - Revert to the legacy TLS 1.2 key logging code for LibreSSL.

  - Document SSLKEYLOGFILE for LibreSSL is TLS 1.2 max.

  Prior to this change if the user specified a filename in the
  SSLKEYLOGFILE environment variable and was using LibreSSL 3.5.0+ then
  an empty file would be created and no keys would be logged.

  This is effectively a revert of e43474b4 which changed openssl.c to use
  SSL_CTX_set_keylog_callback for LibreSSL 3.5.0+. Unfortunately LibreSSL
  added that function only as a stub that doesn't actually do anything.

    no parallelism (was flaky sometimes)
  - OpenBSD, cmake-unity, clang, LibreSSL, x86_64, with tests,
    with python, -j8, TFTP results ignored due to #13623.
  - FreeBSD, cmake-unity and autotools, clang, OpenSSL, arm64
    (Tests disabled for arm64, because they are slow. It's available for
    x86_64 with python, -j12.)
    Configuration matches our existing Cirrus CI one.
  - OmniOS, autotools, gcc, OpenSSL, x86_64, with tests, -j12.

  All build with websockets and examples.

  Closes #13583

- GHA: disable TFTP test on native Windows

  Some TFTP tests seem to enter into a loop and maybe hang?

  E.g. 1007, 1009, 1238

- cmake: do not pass linker flags to the static library tool

  Do not add linker flags to the global CMake static library tool (aka
  "static linker") (e.g. `ar`) flags list. They don't mix well. This was
  only done after successfully detecting GSSAPI.

  Linker flags seen on Old Linux CI:
  ```
  -- |GSS_LINKER_FLAGS|-Wl,--enable-new-dtags -Wl,-rpath -Wl,/usr/lib/x86_64-li
  nux-gnu/heimdal|
  -- |CMAKE_STATIC_LINKER_FLAGS| -Wl,--enable-new-dtags -Wl,-rpath -Wl,/usr/lib
  /x86_64-linux-gnu/heimdal|
  ```
  Ref: https://github.com/curl/curl/actions/runs/9138988036/job/25130791712#ste
  p:6:85

  Causing:
  ```

  ```
  Ref: https://github.com/curl/curl/actions/runs/9138988036/job/25130791712#ste
  p:9:125

  This problem is invisible at the moment because of another bug (#13698)
  that misses building unit tests when not using either the
  `ENABLE_DEBUG=ON` or `ENABLE_CURLDEBUG=ON` options (to set
  `-DCURLDEBUG`):
  ```
  test 1300 SKIPPED: curl lacks unittest support
  ```
  Ref: https://github.com/curl/curl/actions/runs/9135571781/job/25123104557#ste
  p:9:2883

  With that fixed, this becomes the next issue.

  It's possible this bug also required an older CMake version and/or
  a specific OS environment which uses linker flags in GSSAPI that are not
  playing well with `ar` options, to reproduce.

- GHA: add MSYS, mingw-w64, Cygwin jobs

  - re-implement autotools MSYS and Cygwin AppVeyor jobs in GHA.
    Now build with SSL and PSL to improve test coverage.
  - re-implement MSYS2 mingw-w64 gcc 13 AppVeyor job in GHA.
    `CMake, mingw-w64, gcc 13, Debug, x64, Schannel, Static, Unicode`
  - add new cmake Cygwin job (build-only).
  - enable `-j14` parallelism when running tests.
  - delete the 5 migrated jobs from AppVeyor CI.
  - add 2 build-only mingw-w64 builds, gcc Release and clang OpenSSL.
  - also enable brotli, libssh2, nghttp2 for more test coverage.

  These jobs offer better performance, more flexibility and
  parallelization compared to the AppVeyor ones they replace. It also
  offloads AppVeyor, allowing to iterate faster. They also appear more
  reliable than e.g. Azure Windows jobs, where runners are prone to fail
  [1].

- rustls: fix handshake done handling

  - rustls report it has finished the TLS handshake *before*
    all relevant data has been sent off, e.g. it FINISHED message
  - On connections the send data immediately, this was never noticed
    as the FINISHED in rustls buffers was send with the app data
  - On passive FTP connections, curl does not send any data after
    the handshake, leaving FINISHED unsent and the server never
    responded as it was waiting on this.

- cmake: initialize `BUILD_TESTING` before first use

  It did not cause issues when `BUILD_TESTING` was explicitly set.

- ftp: fix build for CURL_DISABLE_VERBOSE_STRINGS

  This is a follow-up to b7c7dffe which changed the FTP state change
  verbose debug text (aka infof) to tracing debug text (aka trc).

  Prior to this change if libcurl was without DEBUGBUILD and built with
  CURL_DISABLE_VERBOSE_STRINGS (ie --disable-verbose) the build would
  error.

  Caught by Circle CI job openssl-no-verbose.

- lib: clear the easy handle's saved errno before transfer

  - Clear data->state.os_errno before transfer.

  - Explain the change in behavior in the CURLINFO_OS_ERRNO doc.

  - Add to the CURLINFO_OS_ERRNO doc the list of libcurl network-related
    errors that may cause the errno to be saved.

  data->state.os_errno is saved before libcurl returns a network-related
  failure such as connection failure. It is accessible to the user via
  CURLINFO_OS_ERRNO so they can get more information about the failure.

  Prior to this change it wasn't cleared before transfer, so if a user
  retrieved the saved errno it could be from a previous transfer. That is
  because an errno is not always saved for network-related errors.

Pavel Pavlov (7 May 2024)

- asyn-thread: fix curl_global_cleanup crash in Windows

  - Make sure that asynchronous resolves handled by Winsock are stopped
    before WSACleanup is called.

  This is implemented by ensuring that when Curl_resolver_kill is called
  (eg via multi_done) it will cancel the Winsock asynchronous resolve and
  wait for the cancellation to complete. Winsock runs the asynchronous
  completion routine immediately when a resolve is canceled.

  Prior to this change it was possible that during curl_global_cleanup
  "a DNS resolver thread created by GetAddrInfoExW did not terminate yet,
  however curl is already shutting down, deinitializing Winsock with
  WSACleanup() leading to an access violation."

  Background:

  If libcurl is built with the asynchronous threaded resolver option for
  Windows then it resolves in one of two ways. For Windows 8.1 and later,
  libcurl resolves by using the Winsock asynchronous resolver which does
  its own thread management. For older versions of Windows, libcurl
  resolves by creating a separate thread that calls getaddrinfo. This
  change only affects the former and it's already handled for the latter.

- dllmain: Call OpenSSL thread cleanup for Windows and Cygwin

  - Call OPENSSL_thread_stop on thread termination (DLL_THREAD_DETACH)
    to prevent a memory leak in case OpenSSL is linked statically.

  - Warn in libcurl-thread.3 that if OpenSSL is linked statically then it
    may require thread cleanup.

  OpenSSL may need per-thread cleanup to stop a memory leak. For Windows
  and Cygwin if libcurl was built as a DLL then we can do that for the
  user by calling OPENSSL_thread_stop on thread termination. However, if
  libcurl was built statically then we do not have notification of thread
  termination and cannot do that for the user.

  Also, there are several other unusual cases where it may be necessary
  for the user to call OPENSSL_thread_stop, so in the libcurl-thread
  warning I added a link to the OpenSSL documentation.

- tool_operate: don't truncate the etag save file by default

  This fixes a regression of 75d79a4486b279100209ddf8c7fdb12955fb66e9. The
  code in tool-operate truncated the etag save file, under the assumption
  that the file would be written with a new etag value. However since
  75d79a4486b279100209ddf8c7fdb12955fb66e9 that might not be the case
  anymore and could result in the file being truncated when --etag-compare
  and --etag-save was used and that the etag value matched with what the
  server responded. Instead the truncation should not be done when a new
  etag value should be written.

  Test 3204 was added to verify that the file with the etag value doesn't
  change the contents when used by --etag-compare and --etage-save and
  that value matches with what the server returns on a non 2xx response.

- multi: introduce SETUP state for better timeouts

  Since we can go to the CONNECT state from PENDING, potentially multiple
  times for a single transfer, this change introdues a SETUP state that
  happens before CONNECT when doing a new transfer.

  Now, doing a redirect on a handle goes back to SETUP (not CONNECT like
  before) and we initilize the connect timeout etc in SETUP. Previously,
  we would do it in CONNECT but that would make it unreliable in cases
  where a transfer goes in and out between CONNECT and PENDING multiple
  times.

  SETUP is transient, so the handle never actually stays in that state.

  Additionally: take care of timeouts of PENDING transfers in
  curl_multi_perform()

- multi: timeout handles even without connection

  When there is a "change" in a multi handle and pending handles are moved
  back to the main list to be retested if they can proceed further (for
  example a previous transfer completed or a connection has a confirmed
  multiplexed state), the timeout check in multi_runsingle() would not
  trigger because it required an established connection.

  This could make a pending tranfer go back to pending state even though
  it had been "in progress" for a longer time than permitted. By removing
  the requirement for an associated connection, the timeout check will be
  done proper even for transfers that has not yet been assigned one.

  character. Testing for a matching value for success will then always
  fail.

  This commit replaces the chariacter comparison by an explicit error
  return check.

- ci: add CMake build variation, fixup libssh detection in `linux-old`

  To test without c-ares and hit `easy_lock.h` on an old system. Use this
  new build step to introduce small variations, and also test libssh2.

  Also add workaround to existing job to enable libssh. (CMake's generic
  auto-detection doesn't seem to work here.):
  ```
  CMake Warning at CMakeLists.txt:908 (find_package):
    Could not find a package configuration file provided by "libssh" with any
    of the following names:

      libsshConfig.cmake

  Closes #13361

- lib: merge `ENABLE_QUIC` C macro into `USE_HTTP3`

  Before this patch `lib/curl_setup.h` defined these two macros right
  next to each other, then the source code used them interchangeably.

  After this patch, `USE_HTTP3` guards all HTTP/3 / QUIC features.
  (Like `USE_HTTP2` does for HTTP/2.) `ENABLE_QUIC` is no longer used.

  This patch doesn't change the way HTTP/3 is enabled via autotools
  or CMake. Builders who enabled HTTP/3 manually by defining both of
  these macros via `CPPFLAGS` can now delete `-DENABLE_QUIC`.

  Closes #13352

- build: prefer `USE_IPV6` macro internally (was: `ENABLE_IPV6`)

  Before this patch, two macros were used to guard IPv6 features in curl
  sources: `ENABLE_IPV6` and `USE_IPV6`. This patch makes the source use
  the latter for consistency with other similar switches.

  `-DENABLE_IPV6` remains accepted for compatibility as a synonym for
  `-DUSE_IPV6`, when passed to the compiler.

  `ENABLE_IPV6` also remains the name of the CMake and `Makefile.vc`
  options to control this feature.

- dist: add reproducible dir entries to tarballs

  In the initial implementation of reproducible tarballs, they were
  missing directory entries, while .zip archives had them. It meant
  that on extracting the tarball, on-disk directory entries got the
  current timestamp.

  This patch fixes this by including directory entries in the tarball,
  with reproducible timestamps. It also moves sorting inside tar,
  to ensure reproducible directory entry timestamps on extract
  (without the need of `--delay-directory-restore` option, when
  extracting with GNU tar. BSD tar got that right by default.)

  GNU tar 1.28 (2014-07-28) introduced `--sort=`.

- cmake: speed up libcurl doc building again

  This time limit the number of files per command to avoid exceeding
  limitations of certain OS/shell envs.

  Such known env is Windows with the `cmd.exe` shell, which features an
  8K command-line length limit to this day.

  Allowlisting `UNIX` to have no limit and using a limit of 200 for other
  envs to be safe. If there is a way to detect `cmd.exe` and/or we know
  which precise envs are sensitive to this, we can tweak these conditions
  further.

  Even with the low limit, this patch reduces external commands by 200x,
  making builds much faster.

- http: with chunked POST forced, disable length check on read callback

  - when an application forces HTTP/1.1 chunked transfer encoding
    by setting the corresponding header and instructs curl to use
    the CURLOPT_READFUNCTION, disregard any POST length information.
  - this establishes backward compatibility with previous curl versions

  Applications are encouraged to not force "chunked", but rather
  set length information for a POST. By setting -1, curl will
  auto-select chunked on HTTP/1.1 and work properly on other HTTP
  versions.

  This commit updates the optional rustls-ffi librustls dependency from
  0.12.0 to 0.13.0. This version is based on the latest available rustls
  release (0.23.4).

  The breaking API changes from 0.12.0 to 0.13.0 are in API surface unused
  by curl, so this is an in-place update without any code changes.

  The `RUSTLS.md` documentation is updated to reflect the new version in
  use, and to clarify that `cbindgen` isn't required to build `librustls`
  - it's only used by developers to update the vendored `rustls.h` header

- http: expect 100 rework

  Move all handling of HTTP's `Expect: 100-continue` feature into a client
  reader. Add sending flag `KEEP_SEND_TIMED` that triggers transfer
  sending on general events like a timer.

  HTTP installs a `CURL_CR_PROTOCOL` reader when announcing `Expect:
  100-continue`. That reader works as follows:

  - on first invocation, records time, starts the `EXPIRE_100_TIMEOUT`
    timer, disables `KEEP_SEND`, enables `KEEP_SEND_TIMER` and returns 0,
    eos=FALSE like a paused upload.

  - on subsequent invocation it checks if the timer has expired. If so, it
    enables `KEEP_SEND` and switches to passing through reads to the
    underlying readers.

  Transfer handling's `readwrite()` will be invoked when a timer expires
  (like `EXPIRE_100_TIMEOUT`) or when data from the server arrives. Seeing
  `KEEP_SEND_TIMER`, it will try to upload more data, which triggers
  reading from the client readers again. Which then may lead to a new
  pausing or cause the upload to start.

  Flags and timestamps connected to this have been moved from
  `SingleRequest` into the reader's context.

- lib: move 'done' parameter to SingleRequests

  A transfer may do several `SingleRequest`s for its success. This happens
  regularly for authentication, follows and retries on failed connections.
  The "readwrite()" calls and functions connected to those carried a `bool
  *done` parameter to indicate that the current `SingleRequest` is over.
  This may happen before `upload_done` or `download_done` bits of
  `SingleRequest` are set.

  The problem with that is now `write_resp()` protocol handlers are
  invoked in places where the `bool *done` cannot be passed up to the
  caller. Instead of being a bool in the call chain, it needs to become a
  member of `SingleRequest`, reflecting its state.

  This removes the `bool *done` parameter and adds the `done` bit to
  `SingleRequest` instead. It adds `Curl_req_soft_reset()` for using a
  `SingleRequest` in a follow up, clearing `done` and other
  flags/counters.

- smpt: fix starttls

  In cases where the connection was fast, curl sometimes failed to open a
  connection. This fixes a regression of c2d973627bab12abc5486a3f3.

  The regression triggered in these steps:

  1. Create an smtp connection
  2. Use STARTTLS
  3. Receive the response
  4. We are inside the loop in `smtp_statemachine`, calling
     `smtp_state_starttls_resp`
  5. In the good flow, we exit the loop, re-enter `smtp_statemachine` and
     run `smtp_perform_upgrade_tls` at the start of the function.

     In the bad flow, we stay in the while loop, calling
     `Curl_pp_readresp`, which reads part of the TLS handshake and things
     go wrong.

  The reason is that `Curl_pp_moredata` changed behavior and always
  returns `true`, so we stay in the loop in `smtp_statemachine`. With a
  slow connection `Curl_pp_readresp` cannot read new data and returns
  `CURL_AGAIN`, so we leave the loop and re-enter `smtp_statemachine`.

  With a fast connection, `Curl_pp_readresp` reads new data from the tcp
  connection, which is part of the TLS handshake.

  The fix is in `Curl_pp_moredata`, which needs to take the final line
  into account and return `false` if only the final line is stored.

  - fix a bug in websocket `curl_ws_recv()` that mixed up data
    when it arrived in more than a single chunk (to be made
    into a sperate PR, also)

  Added as documented [in
  CLIENT-READER.md](https://github.com/curl/curl/blob/5b1f31dfbab8aef467c419c68
  aa06dc738cb75d4/docs/CLIENT-READERS.md).

  - old `Curl_buffer_send()` completely replaced by new `Curl_req_send()`
  - old `Curl_fillreadbuffer()` replaced with `Curl_client_read()`
  - HTTP chunked uploads are now formatted in a client reader added when
    needed.
  - FTP line-end conversions are done in a client reader added when
    needed.
  - when sending requests headers, remaining buffer space is filled with
    body data for sending in "one go". This is independent of the request
    body size. Resolves #12938 as now small and large requests have the
    same code path.

  Changes done to test cases:

  - test513: now fails before sending request headers as this initial
    "client read" triggers the setup fault. Behaves now the same as in
    hyper build
  - test547, test555, test1620: fix the length check in the lib code to
    only fail for reads *smaller* than expected. This was a bug in the
    test code that never triggered in the old implementation.

  Closes #12969

- fopen: fix narrowing conversion warning on 32-bit Android

  This was fixed in commit 06dc599405f, but came back in commit
  03cb1ff4d62.

  When building for 32-bit ARM or x86 Android, `st_mode` is defined as
  `unsigned int` instead of `mode_t`, resulting in a
  `-Wimplicit-int-conversion` clang warning because `mode_t` is
  `unsigned short`. Add a cast to silence the warning, but only for
  32-bit Android builds, because other architectures and platforms are
  not affected.

- lib: Curl_read/Curl_write clarifications

    `Curl_xfer_send()/Curl_xfer_recv()` which no longer has

    connection filter chain to operate.
  - send/recv on a specific connection filter chain is done via

    as parameter.
  - rename `Curl_setup_transfer()` to `Curl_xfer_setup()` for

  - clarify that the special CURLE_AGAIN hangling to return

    and CURLE_AGAIN is returned by all other send() variants.
  - fix a bug in websocket `curl_ws_recv()` that mixed up data
    when it arrived in more than a single chunk

  The method for sending not just raw bytes, but bytes that are either
  "headers" or "body". The send abstraction stack, to to bottom, now is:

  * `Curl_req_send()`: has parameter to indicate amount of header bytes,
    buffers all data.
  * `Curl_xfer_send()`: knows on which socket index to send, returns
    amount of bytes sent.
  * `Curl_conn_send()`: called with socket index, returns amount of bytes
    sent.

  In addition there is `Curl_req_flush()` for writing out all buffered
  bytes.

  `Curl_req_send()` is active for requests without body,
  `Curl_buffer_send()` still being used for others. This is because the
  special quirks need to be addressed in future parts:

  * `expect-100` handling
  * `Curl_fillreadbuffer()` needs to add directly to the new
    `data->req.sendbuf`
  * special body handlings, like `chunked` encodings and line end
    conversions will be moved into something like a Client Reader.

  In functions of the pattern `CURLcode xxx_send(..., ssize_t *written)`,
  replace the `ssize_t` with a `size_t`. It makes no sense to allow for negativ
  e
  values as the returned `CURLcode` already specifies error conditions. This
  allows easier handling of lengths without casting.

- lib: move client writer into own source

  Refactoring of the client writer that passes the data to the
  client/application's callback functions.

  - split out into own source cw-out.[ch] from sendf.c

  - move tempwrite and tempcount from data->state into the context of the
    client writer

  - redesign the 3 tempwrite dynbufs as a linked list of dynbufs. On
    paused transfers, this allows to "record" interleaved HEADER/BODY
    chunks to be "played back" in the same order on unpausing.

  - keep the overall size limit of all buffered data to DYN_PAUSE_BUFFER.
    On exceeding that, return CURLE_TOO_LARGE instead of
    CURLE_OUT_OF_MEMORY as before.

  - add method to be called when a transfer is DONE to allow writing of
    any data still buffered

    playback. HEADERs are documented to be written one-by-one.

- schannel: fix hang on unexpected server close

  - Treat TLS connection close (either due to a close_notify from the

  This is because in some cases schannel_recv knows the connection is
  closed but has to return actual pending data so it can't return 0 or an
  error to indicate no more data. In this case schannel_recv must be
  called again, which only happens if readwrite_data sees that there is
  still pending data.

  Prior to this change if the total size of the body that libcurl expected
  to receive from the server was unknown then it was possible under some
  network conditions that libcurl would hang waiting to receive more data,
  when in fact a close_notify alert indicating no more data would be sent
  was already processed.

- ftp: treat a 226 arriving before data as a signal to read data

  For active mode transfers.

  Due to some interesting timing, curl can sometimes get the 226 (transfer
  complete) over the control channel first, before the data connection
  signals readability. If this happens, use that as a signal to check the
  data connection.

  Additionally, set the socket filter in listen mode *before* the
  PORT/EPRT command is issued, to reduce the risk that the little time gap
  could interfere.

  rounds for me to trigger on my mac.

- sasl: make login option string override http auth

  - Use http authentication mechanisms as a default, not a preset.

  Consider http authentication options which are mapped to SASL options as
  a default (overriding the hardcoded default mask for the protocol) that
  is ignored if a login option string is given.

  Prior to this change, if some HTTP auth options were given, sasl mapped
  http authentication options to sasl ones but merged them with the login
  options.

  That caused problems with the cli tool that sets the http login option
  CURLAUTH_BEARER as a side-effect of --oauth2-bearer, because this flag
  maps to more than one sasl mechanisms and the latter cannot be cleared
  individually by the login options string.

  New test 992 checks this.

- urlapi: remove assert

  This assert triggers wrongly when CURLU_GUESS_SCHEME and
  CURLU_NO_AUTHORITY are both set and the URL is a single path.

- mksymbolsmanpage.pl: provide references to where the symbol is used

- docs: introduce "curldown" for libcurl man page format

  curldown is this new file format for libcurl man pages. It is markdown
  inspired with differences:

  - Each file has a set of leading headers with meta-data
  - Supports a small subset of markdown
  - Uses .md file extensions for editors/IDE/GitHub to treat them nicely
  - Generates man pages very similar to the previous ones
  - Generates man pages that still convert nicely to HTML on the website
  - Detects and highlights mentions of curl symbols automatically (when
    their man page section is specified)

  tools:

  - cd2nroff: converts from curldown to nroff man page
  - nroff2cd: convert an (old) nroff man page to curldown
  - cdall: convert many nroff pages to curldown versions
  - cd2cd: verifies and updates a curldown to latest curldown

  This setup generates .3 versions of all the curldown versions at build time.

  CI:

  Since the documentation is now technically markdown in the eyes of many
  things, the CI runs many more tests and checks on this documentation,
  including proselint, link checkers and tests that make sure we capitalize the
  first letter after a period...

  - configure with `--with-openssl-quic` to enable curl to

  - implementation with the following restrictions:
    * macOS has to use an unconnected UDP socket due to an

      in processing delays or Transfer-Encodings on proxied
      requests
    * uploads that encounter blocks will use 100% cpu as

- tool_getparam: stop supporting `@filename` style for --cookie

  The `@filename` style was never documented for --cookie <data|filename>
  but prior to this change curl would accept it anyway and always treat a
  @ prefixed string as a filename.

  That's a problem if the string also contains a = sign because then it is
  documented to be interpreted as a cookie string and not a filename.

  Example:

  `--cookie @foo=bar`

  Before: Interpreted as load cookies from filename foo=bar.

  After: Interpreted as cookie `@foo=bar` (name `@foo` and value `bar`).

  Other curl options with a data/filename option-value use the `@filename`
  to distinguish filenames which is probably how this happened. The
  --cookie option has never been documented that way.

- lib: replace readwrite with write_resp

  This clarifies the handling of server responses by folding the code for
  the complicated protocols into their protocol handlers. This concerns
  mainly HTTP and its bastard sibling RTSP.

  The terms "read" and "write" are often used without clear context if
  they refer to the connect or the client/application side of a
  transfer. This PR uses "read/write" for operations on the client side
  and "send/receive" for the connection, e.g. server side. If this is
  considered useful, we can revisit renaming of further methods in another
  PR.

  Curl's protocol handler `readwrite()` method been changed:

  ```diff
  -  CURLcode (*readwrite)(struct Curl_easy *data, struct connectdata *conn,
  -                        const char *buf, size_t blen,
  -                        size_t *pconsumed, bool *readmore);
  +  CURLcode (*write_resp)(struct Curl_easy *data, const char *buf, size_t ble
  n,
  +                         bool is_eos, bool *done);
  ```

  The name was changed to clarify that this writes reponse data to the
  client side. The parameter changes are:

  * `conn` removed as it always operates on `data->conn`
  * `pconsumed` removed as the method needs to handle all data on success
  * `readmore` removed as no longer necessary
  * `is_eos` as indicator that this is the last call for the transfer
    response (end-of-stream).
  * `done` TRUE on return iff the transfer response is to be treated as
    finished

  This change affects many files only because of updated comments in
  handlers that provide no implementation. The real change is that the
  HTTP protocol handlers now provide an implementation.

  The HTTP protocol handlers `write_resp()` implementation will get passed
  **all** raw data of a server response for the transfer. The HTTP/1.x
  formatted status and headers, as well as the undecoded response
  body. `Curl_http_write_resp_hds()` is used internally to parse the
  response headers and pass them on. This method is public as the RTSP
  protocol handler also uses it.

  HTTP/1.1 "chunked" transport encoding is now part of the general
  *content encoding* writer stack, just like other encodings. A new flag
  `CLIENTWRITE_EOS` was added for the last client write. This allows
  writers to verify that they are in a valid end state. The chunked
  decoder will check if it indeed has seen the last chunk.

  The general response handling in `transfer.c:466` happens in function
  `readwrite_data()`. This mainly operates now like:

  ```
  static CURLcode readwrite_data(data, ...)
  {
    do {
      Curl_xfer_recv_resp(data, buf)
      ...
      Curl_xfer_write_resp(data, buf)
      ...
    } while(interested);
    ...
  }
  ```

  All the response data handling is implemented in
  `Curl_xfer_write_resp()`. It calls the protocol handler's `write_resp()`
  implementation if available, or does the default behaviour.

  All raw response data needs to pass through this function. Which also
  means that anyone in possession of such data may call
  `Curl_xfer_write_resp()`.

  To force users to explictily disable it if they really don't want it
  used and make it harder to accidentally miss it.

  --without-libpsl is the option to use if PSL is not wanted.

- tool_getparam: make data_urlencode avoid direct malloc

- tool_getparam: move the --url-query logic into url_query()

  This function is not doing post at all so it was always weirdly placed.

- tool_getparam: move the --data logic into set_data()

- tool_getparam: unify the cmdline switch() into a single one

  - easier to follow, easier to modify, easier to extend, possibly slightly
    faster

  - each case now has the long option as a comment

- tool_getparam: bsearch cmdline options

  - the option names are now alpha sorted and lookup is a lot faster

  - use case sensitive matching. It was previously case insensitive, but that
    was not documented nor tested.

  - remove "partial match" feature. It was not documented, not tested and
    was always fragile as existing use could break when we add a new
    option

  - lookup short options via a table

- transfer: adjust_pollset improvements

  - let `multi_getsock()` initialize the pollset in what the
    transfer state requires in regards to SEND/RECV
  - change connection filters `adjust_pollset()` implementation
    to react on the presence of POLLIN/-OUT in the pollset and
    no longer check CURL_WANT_SEND/CURL_WANT_RECV
  - cf-socket will no longer add POLLIN on its own
  - http2 and http/3 filters will only do adjustments if the
    passed pollset wants to POLLIN/OUT for the transfer on
    the socket. This is similar to the HTTP/2 proxy filter
    and works in stacked filters.

- appveyor: replace PowerShell with bash + parallel autotools

  PowerShell works (after a steep development curve), but one property of
  it stuck and kept causing unresolvable usability issues: With
  `$ErrorActionPreference=Stop`, it does abort on failures, but shows only
  the first line of the error message. In `Continue` mode, it shows the
  full error message, but doesn't stop on all errors. Another issue is
  PowerShell considering any stderr output as if the command failed (this
  has been improved in 7.2 (2021-Nov), but fixed versions aren't running
  in CI and will not be for a long time in all test images.)

  Thus, we're going with bash.

  Also:
  - use `-j2` with autotools tests, making them finish 5-15 minutes per
    job faster.
  - omit `POSIX_PATH_PREFIX`.
  - use `WINDIR`.
  - prefer forward slashes.

  This issue was found when during vcpkg installation. Running command

- build: remove redundant `CURL_PULL_*` settings

  These macros were not propagated to the source code from CMake.

  autotools set only one of them (`CURL_PULL_SYS_POLL_H`), initially to

  [2] without the logic it enabled. A subsequent fix [3] re-added the
  logic, and also enabled it for AIX before its use, directly in
  `system.h`.

- system.h: sync mingw `CURL_TYPEOF_CURL_SOCKLEN_T` with other compilers

  Align mingw with the other Windows compilers and use the `int` type for
  `CURL_TYPEOF_CURL_SOCKLEN_T` (and thus for `curl_socklent_t`). This
  makes it unnecessary to make a mingw-specific trick and pull all Windows
  headers early just for this type definition. This type is specific to
  Windows, not to the compiler. mingw-w64's Windows header maps it to
  `int` too.

  With this we also delete all remaining uses of `CURL_PULL_WS2TCPIP_H`.

  [ The official solution is to use `socklen_t` for all Windows compilers.
  In this case we may want to update `curl/curl.h` to pull in Windows
  headers before `system.h`. ]

- test1474: removed

  The test was already somewhat flaky and disabled on several platforms,

- readwrite_data: loop less

  This function is made to loop in order to drain incoming data
  faster. Completely removing the loop has a measerably negative impact on
  transfer speeds.

  Downsides with the looping include

  - it might call the progress callback much more seldom. Especially if
    the write callback is slow.

  - rate limiting becomes less exact

  - a single transfer might "starve out" other parallel transfers

  - QUIC timers for other connections can't be maintained correctly

  The long term fix should be to remove the loop and optimize coming back
  to avoid the transfer speed penalty.

  This fix lower the max loop count to reduce the starvation problem, and
  avoids the loop completely for when rate-limiting is in progress.

  Q: "The cmake build selected to run gcc with -fPIC on my box while the

  A: With CMake, since 2ebc74c36a19a1700af394c16855ce144d9878e3 #11546
     and fc9bfb14520712672b4784e8b48256fb29204011 #11627, we explicitly
     enable PIC for libcurl shared lib. Or when building libcurl for
     shared and static lib in a single pass. We do this by default for
     Windows or when enabled by the user via `SHARE_LIB_OBJECT`.
     Otherwise we don't touch this setting. Meaning the default set by
     CMake (if any) or the toolchain is used. On Debian Bookworm, this
     means that PIC is disabled for static libs by default. Some platforms
     (like macOS), has PIC enabled by default.
     autotools supports the double-pass mode only, and in that case
     CMake seems to match PIC behaviour now (as tested on Linux with gcc.)

- cmake: delete obsolete TODO items [ci skip]

  There is always room for improvement, but CMake is up to par now with

  Answering one of questions:

  Q: "The gcc command line use neither -g nor any -O options. As a
     developer, I also treasure our configure scripts's --enable-debug
     option that sets a long range of "picky" compiler options."

  A: CMake offers the `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` variable to control debug info
     and optimization level. E.g.:
     - `Release`    = `-O3` + no debug info
     - `MinSizeRel` = `-Os` + no debug info
     - `Debug`      = `-O0` + debug info

- vtls: consistently use typedef names for OpenSSL structs

  The foo_st names don't appear in OpenSSL public API documentation. The
  FOO typedefs are more common. This header was already referencing
  SSL_CTX via <openssl/ssl.h>. There is a comment about avoiding
  <openssl/x509v3.h>, but OpenSSL actually declares all the typedefs in
  <openssl/ossl_typ.h>, which is already included by <openssl/ssl.h> (and
  every other OpenSSL header), so just use that. Though I've included it
  just to be explicit.

  (I'm also fairly sure including <openssl/ssl.h> already triggers the
  Schannel conflicts anyway. The comment was probably just out of date.)

- tool_writeout_json: fix JSON encoding of non-ascii bytes

  char variables if unspecified can be either signed or unsigned depending
  on the platform according to the C standard; in most platforms, they are
  signed.

  This meant that the  *i<32  waas always true for bytes with the top bit
  set. So they were always getting encoded as \uXXXX, and then since they
  were also signed negative, they were getting extended with 1s causing
  '\xe2' to be expanded to \uffffffe2, for example:

    $ curl --variable 'v=“' --expand-write-out '{{v:json}}\n' file:///dev/nul
  l
    \uffffffe2\uffffff80\uffffff9c

  I fixed this bug by making the code use explicitly unsigned char*
  variables instead of char* variables.

  Use the closure handle for disconnecting connection cache entries so
  that anything that happens during the disconnect is not stored and

  and it is important that details from the unrelated disconnect does not
  taint meta-data in the data handle.

  Like storing the response code.

  This also adjust test 1506. Unfortunately it also removes a key part of
  the test that verifies that a connection is closed since when this

  exactly that the connection actually gets closed in this test...

- windows: use built-in `_WIN32` macro to detect Windows

  Windows compilers define `_WIN32` automatically. Windows SDK headers
  or build env defines `WIN32`, or we have to take care of it. The
  agreement seems to be that `_WIN32` is the preferred practice here.
  Make the source code rely on that to detect we're building for Windows.

  Public `curl.h` was using `WIN32`, `__WIN32__` and `CURL_WIN32` for
  Windows detection, next to the official `_WIN32`. After this patch it
  only uses `_WIN32` for this. Also, make it stop defining `CURL_WIN32`.

  There is a slight chance these break compatibility with Windows
  compilers that fail to define `_WIN32`. I'm not aware of any obsolete
  or modern compiler affected, but in case there is one, one possible
  solution is to define this macro manually.

  grepping for `WIN32` remains useful to discover Windows-specific code.

  Also:

  - extend `checksrc` to ensure we're not using `WIN32` anymore.

  - apply minor formatting here and there.

  - delete unnecessary checks for `!MSDOS` when `_WIN32` is present.

    This was due to force-disabling the header guard of `warnless.h` to

    - stop calling `strcmp()` with NULL to avoid undefined behaviour.
    - fix checking results if some of them were NULL.
    - do not pass NULL to printf `%s`.

  - ci: keep a build job with `-std=gnu89` to continue testing for

- hyper: temporarily remove HTTP/2 support

  The current design of the Hyper integration requires rebuilding the
  Hyper clientconn for each request. However, building the clientconn
  requires resending the HTTP/2 connection preface, which is incorrect
  from a protocol perspective. That in turn causes servers to send GOAWAY
  frames, effectively degrading performance to "no connection reuse" in
  the best case. It may also be triggering some bugs where requests get
  dropped entirely and reconnects take too long.

  This doesn't rule out HTTP/2 support with Hyper, but it may take a
  redesign of the Hyper integration in order to make things work.

- url: find scheme with a "perfect hash"

  Instead of a loop to scan over the potentially 30+ scheme names, this
  uses a "perfect hash" table. This works fine because the set of schemes
  is known and cannot change in a build. The hash algorithm and table size
  is made to only make a single scheme index per table entry.

  The perfect hash is generated by a separate tool (scripts/schemetable.c)

  Closes #12347

- scripts: add schemetable.c

  This tool generates a scheme-matching table.

  It iterates over a number of different initial and shift values in order
  to find the hash algorithm that needs the smallest possible table.

  The generated hash function, table and table size then needs to be used
  by the url.c:Curl_getn_scheme_handler() function.

  1. Because the value is not strictly set with a setopt option.

  2. Because otherwise when duping a handle when all the set.* fields are
     first copied and an error happens (think out of memory mid-function),

     which could lead to a double-free.

  Closes #12323

Viktor Szakats (14 Nov 2023)

- autotools: avoid passing `LDFLAGS` twice to libcurl

  autotools passes `LDFLAGS` automatically linker commands. curl's
  `lib/Makefile.am` customizes libcurl linker flags. In that
  customization, it added `LDFLAGS` to the custom flags. This resulted in
  passing `LDFLAGS` _twice_ to the `libtool` command.

  Most of the time this is benign, but some `LDFLAGS` options can break
  the build when passed twice. One such example is passing `.o` files,
  e.g. `crt*.o` files necessary when customizing the C runtime, e.g. for
  MUSL builds.

  Passing them twice resulted in duplicate symbol errors:
  ```
  libtool: link:  clang-15 --target=aarch64-unknown-linux-musl [...] /usr/lib/a
  arch64-linux-musl/crt1.o [...] /usr/lib/aarch64-linux-musl/crt1.o [...]
  ld.lld-15: error: duplicate symbol: _start
  >>> defined at crt1.c
  >>>            /usr/lib/aarch64-linux-musl/crt1.o:(.text+0x0)
  >>> defined at crt1.c
  >>>            /usr/lib/aarch64-linux-musl/crt1.o:(.text+0x0)
  [...]
  clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocatio
  n)
  ```

  This behaviour came with commit 1a593191c2769a47b8c3e4d9715ec9f6dddf5e36
  (2013-07-23) as a fix for bug https://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=1217.
  The patch was a works-for-me hack that ended up merged in curl:
  https://sourceforge.net/p/curl/bugs/1217/#06ef
  With the root cause remaining unclear.

  Perhaps the SUNPro 12 linker was sensitive to `-L` `-l` order, requiring
  `-L` first? This would be unusual and suggests a bug in either the
  linker or in `libtool`.

  The curl build does pass the list of detected libs via its own
  `LIBCURL_LIBS` variable, which ends up before `LDFLAGS` on the `libtool`
  command line, but it's the job of `libtool` to ensure that even
  a peculiar linker gets the options in the expected order. Also because
  autotools passes `LDFLAGS` last, making it hardly possible to pass
  anything after it.

  Perhaps in the 10 years since this issue, this already got a fix
  upstream.

  This patch deletes `LDFLAGS` from our customized libcurl options,
  leaving a single copy of them as passed by autotools automatically.

  Reverts 1a593191c2769a47b8c3e4d9715ec9f6dddf5e36
  Closes #12310

- autotools: accept linker flags via `CURL_LDFLAGS_{LIB,BIN}`

  To allow passing `LDFLAGS` specific to libcurl (`CURL_LDFLAGS_LIB`) and
  curl tool (`CURL_LDFLAGS_BIN`).

  This makes it possible to build libcurl and curl with a single
  invocation with lib- and tool-specific custom linker flags.

  Such flag can be enabling `.map` files, a `.def` file for libcurl DLL,
  controlling static/shared, incl. requesting a static curl tool (with
  `-static-libtool-libs`) while building both shared and static libcurl.

  curl-for-win uses the above and some more.

  These options are already supported in `Makefile.mk`. CMake has built-in
  variables for this.

- tool_cb_hdr: add an additional parsing check

  - Don't dereference the past-the-end element when parsing the server's

  As 'p' is advanced it can point to the past-the-end element and prior
  to this change 'p' could be dereferenced in that case.

  Technically the past-the-end element is not out of bounds because dynbuf
  (which manages the header line) automatically adds a null terminator to
  every buffer and that is not included in the buffer length passed to
  the header callback.

- projects: add VC14.20 project files

  Windows projects included VC14, VC14.10, VC14.30 but not VC14.20.
  OpenSSL and Wolf SSL scripts mention VC14.20 so I don't see a reason why
  this is missing. Updated the templates to produce a VC14.20 project.
  Project opens in Visual Studio 2019 as expected.

- build: delete support bits for obsolete Windows compilers

  - Pelles C: Unclear status, failed to obtain a fresh copy a few months
    ago. Possible website is HTTP-only. ~10 years ago I left this compiler
    dealing with crashes and other issues with no response on the forum
    for years. It has seen some activity in curl back in 2021.
  - LCC: Last stable release in September 2002.
  - Salford C: Misses winsock2 support, possibly abandoned? Last mentioned
    in 2006.
  - Borland C++: We dropped Borland C++ support in 2018.
  - MS Visual C++ 6.0: Released in 1998. curl already requires VS 2010
    (or possibly 2008) as a minimum.

  Closes #12222

- build: delete `HAVE_STDINT_H` and `HAVE_INTTYPES_H`

  We use `stdint.h` unconditionally in all places except one. These uses
  are imposed by external dependencies / features. nghttp2, quic, wolfSSL
  and `HAVE_MACH_ABSOLUTE_TIME` do require this C99 header. It means that
  any of these features make curl require a C99 compiler. (In case of
  MSVC, this means Visual Studio 2010 or newer.)

  This patch changes the single use of `stdint.h` guarded by
  `HAVE_STDINT_H` to use `stdint.h` unconditionally. Also stop using
  `inttypes.h` as an alternative there. `HAVE_INTTYPES_H` wasn't used
  anywhere else, allowing to delete this feature check as well.

  Closes #12275

- lib: client writer, part 2, accounting + logging

  This PR has these changes:

  Renaming of unencode_* to cwriter, e.g. client writers
  - documentation of sendf.h functions
  - move max decode stack checks back to content_encoding.c
  - define writer phase which was used as order before
  - introduce phases for monitoring inbetween decode phases
  - offering default implementations for init/write/close

  Add type paramter to client writer's do_write()
  - always pass all writes through the writer stack
  - writers who only care about BODY data will pass other writes unchanged

  add RAW and PROTOCOL client writers
  - RAW used for Curl_debug() logging of CURLINFO_DATA_IN
  - PROTOCOL used for updates to data->req.bytecount, max_filesize checks and
    Curl_pgrsSetDownloadCounter()
  - remove all updates of data->req.bytecount and calls to
    Curl_pgrsSetDownloadCounter() and Curl_debug() from other code
  - adjust test457 expected output to no longer see the excess write

- rand: fix build error with autotools + LibreSSL

  autotools unexpectedly detects `arc4random` because it is also looking
  into dependency libs. One dependency, LibreSSL, happens to publish an
  `arc4random` function (via its shared lib before v3.7, also via static
  lib as of v3.8.2). When trying to use this function in `lib/rand.c`,
  its protoype is missing. To fix that, curl included a prototype, but
  that used a C99 type without including `stdint.h`, causing:

  ```
  ../../lib/rand.c:37:1: error: unknown type name 'uint32_t'
     37 | uint32_t arc4random(void);
        | ^
  1 error generated.
  ```

  This patch improves this by dropping the local prototype and instead
  limiting `arc4random` use for non-OpenSSL builds. OpenSSL builds provide
  their own random source anyway.

  The better fix would be to teach autotools to not link dependency libs
  while detecting `arc4random`.

  LibreSSL publishing a non-namespaced `arc4random` tracked here:

- openssl: identify the "quictls" backend correctly

  Since vanilla OpenSSL does not support the QUIC API I think it helps
  users to identify the correct OpenSSL fork in version output. The best
  (crude) way to do that right now seems to be to check if ngtcp2 support
  is enabled.

  Closes #12270

- curl: improved IPFS and IPNS URL support

  Previously just ipfs://<cid> and ipns://<cid> was supported, which is
  too strict for some usecases.

  This patch allows paths and query arguments to be used too.
  Making this work according to normal http semantics:

   ipfs://<cid>/foo/bar?key=val
   ipns://<cid>/foo/bar?key=val

  The gateway url support is changed.
  It now only supports gateways in the form of:

   http://<gateway>/foo/bar
   http://<gateway>

  Query arguments here are explicitly not allowed and trigger an intended
  malformed url error.

  There also was a crash when IPFS_PATH was set with a non trailing
  forward slash. This has been fixed.

  Lastly, a load of test cases have been added to verify the above.
