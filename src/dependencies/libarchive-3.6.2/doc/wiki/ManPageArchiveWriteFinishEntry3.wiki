== NAME == 
'''archive_write_finish_entry''' 
- functions for creating archives 
== LIBRARY == 
Streaming Archive Library (libarchive, -larchive) 
== SYNOPSIS == 
'''<nowiki>#include <archive.h></nowiki>''' 
<br> 
''int'' 
<br> 
'''archive_write_finish_entry'''(''struct archive *''); 
== DESCRIPTION == 
Close out the entry just written. 
In particular, this writes out the final padding required by some formats. 
Ordinarily, clients never need to call this, as it 
is called automatically by 
'''archive_write_header'''() 
and 
'''archive_write_close'''() 
as needed. 
For 
'''archive_write_disk''' 
handles, this flushes pending file attribute changes like modification time. 
== RETURN VALUES == 
This function returns 
'''ARCHIVE_OK''' 
on success, or one of several non-zero 
error codes for errors. 
Specific error codes include: 
'''ARCHIVE_RETRY''' 
for operations that might succeed if retried, 
'''ARCHIVE_WARN''' 
for unusual conditions that do not prevent further operations, and 
'''ARCHIVE_FATAL''' 
for serious errors that make remaining operations impossible. 
== ERRORS == 
Detailed error codes and textual descriptions are available from the 
'''archive_errno'''() 
and 
'''archive_error_string'''() 
functions.
