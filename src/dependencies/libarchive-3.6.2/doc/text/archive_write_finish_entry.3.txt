ARCHIVE_WRITE_FINISH_... BSD Library Functions Manual ARCHIVE_WRITE_FINISH_...

NAME
     archive_write_finish_entry — functions for creating archives

LIBRARY
     Streaming Archive Library (libarchive, -larchive)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <archive.h>

     int
     archive_write_finish_entry(struct archive *);

DESCRIPTION
     Close out the entry just written.	In particular, this writes out the fi‐
     nal padding required by some formats.  Ordinarily, clients never need to
     call this, as it is called automatically by archive_write_header() and
     archive_write_close() as needed.  For archive_write_disk handles, this
     flushes pending file attribute changes like modification time.

RETURN VALUES
     This function returns ARCHIVE_OK on success, or one of several non-zero
     error codes for errors.  Specific error codes include: ARCHIVE_RETRY for
     operations that might succeed if retried, ARCHIVE_WARN for unusual condi‐
     tions that do not prevent further operations, and ARCHIVE_FATAL for seri‐
     ous errors that make remaining operations impossible.

ERRORS
     Detailed error codes and textual descriptions are available from the
     archive_errno() and archive_error_string() functions.
