ARCHIVE_READ_DATA(3)	 BSD Library Functions Manual	  ARCHIVE_READ_DATA(3)

NAME
     archive_read_data, archive_read_data_block, archive_read_data_skip,
     archive_read_data_into_fd — functions for reading streaming archives

LIBRARY
     Streaming Archive Library (libarchive, -larchive)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <archive.h>

     la_ssize_t
     archive_read_data(struct archive *, void *buff, size_t len);

     int
     archive_read_data_block(struct archive *, const void **buff, size_t *len,
	 off_t *offset);

     int
     archive_read_data_skip(struct archive *);

     int
     archive_read_data_into_fd(struct archive *, int fd);

DESCRIPTION
     archive_read_data()
	     Read data associated with the header just read.  Internally, this
	     is a convenience function that calls archive_read_data_block()
	     and fills any gaps with nulls so that callers see a single con‐
	     tinuous stream of data.
     archive_read_data_block()
	     Return the next available block of data for this entry.  Unlike
	     archive_read_data(), the archive_read_data_block() function
	     avoids copying data and allows you to correctly handle sparse
	     files, as supported by some archive formats.  The library guaran‐
	     tees that offsets will increase and that blocks will not overlap.
	     Note that the blocks returned from this function can be much
	     larger than the block size read from disk, due to compression and
	     internal buffer optimizations.
     archive_read_data_skip()
	     A convenience function that repeatedly calls
	     archive_read_data_block() to skip all of the data for this ar‐
	     chive entry.  Note that this function is invoked automatically by
	     archive_read_next_header2() if the previous entry was not com‐
	     pletely consumed.
     archive_read_data_into_fd()
	     A convenience function that repeatedly calls
	     archive_read_data_block() to copy the entire entry to the pro‐
	     vided file descriptor.

RETURN VALUES
     Most functions return zero on success, non-zero on error.	The possible
     return codes include: ARCHIVE_OK (the operation succeeded), ARCHIVE_WARN
     (the operation succeeded but a non-critical error was encountered),
     ARCHIVE_EOF (end-of-archive was encountered), ARCHIVE_RETRY (the opera‐
     tion failed but can be retried), and ARCHIVE_FATAL (there was a fatal er‐
     ror; the archive should be closed immediately).

     archive_read_data() returns a count of bytes actually read or zero at the
     end of the entry.	On error, a value of ARCHIVE_FATAL, ARCHIVE_WARN, or
     ARCHIVE_RETRY is returned.

ERRORS
     Detailed error codes and textual descriptions are available from the
     archive_errno() and archive_error_string() functions.
